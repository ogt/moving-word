The primary purpose of this project is to refamiliarize with javascript.

To do that I want to create a simple page that satisfied a personal curiosity:
I want to understand how easy it is to perform object recognition under limited resource constraints.
To simplify the test I don't use full blown video but a simplistic single dimensional animation in the form of a 
string where the "object/shape" is a word moving within the string
The goal of this code
a) create a semi-realisticially moving shape  (using some combination of keyboard inputing etc)
b) record the video under some sampling frequency
c) Use a highly constrained system (low mem, low cpy, high FPS) to "watch" the recording's playback.
that attempts to see the interesting characteristics (in this case the moving word)
e) Produce a playback of what the system sees and compare with the original recording playback
